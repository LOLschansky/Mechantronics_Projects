Understanding CDC, IO, and ADC on the Raspberry PI.

This code:
1. Turns on an LED
2. Waits until a button is pressed
3. Turns off the LED
4. Asks the user to enter a number of analog samples to take, between 1 and 100
5. Reads the number entered by the user
6. Reads the voltage on ADC0 that number of times at 100Hz
7. Prints back the voltages in the units of volts
8. then loops
